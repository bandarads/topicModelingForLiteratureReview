1,  The determinants of transnational entrepreneurship and transnational ties’ dynamics among immigrant entrepreneurs in ICT sector in Italy?   This article contributes to the rapidly growing literature on transnational immigrant entrepreneurship by analyzing the determinants of transnational entrepreneurial engagement among immigrants in the ICT sector in Italy. We investigate which factors influence the rise or decline of transnational entrepreneurial involvement with a home country. Our results indicate that longer residence in Italy is associated with smaller propensity to become a transnational entrepreneur. Moreover  we find that the type of transnational ties and the network size have a substantial impact on the dynamics of transnational entrepreneurial engagement.
2," Market orientation and strategic decisions on immigrant and ethnic small firms""   Entrepreneurial orientation in small ethnic firms is embedded in a strong sociocultural environment  which influences their market orientation. For this reason  entrepreneurs choose between either focusing their businesses on their ethnic communities or attracting mainstream customers from outside their ethnic enclave. The article aims to contribute to the knowledge of ethnic and immigrant firms by taking a detailed look at their marketing orientation and strategic decisions. To perform this study  the researchers used a multi-method qualitative data collection  including the analysis of different entrepreneur cases  within several Brazilian communities overseas  which illustrate four different marketing orientations of ethnic entrepreneurs: (i) “focus on the ethnic niche market ” (ii) “focus on specific interests ” (iii) “focus on exotic products for the mainstream customer ” and (iv) “focus on highly competitive markets.” Authors draw a 2x2 matrix as an output of the research."
3, Diaspora networks in international business: a review on an emerging stream of research?   Diaspora networks in international business are an influential construct in understanding contemporary international business (IB)  respective networks  and global activities. This chapter analyzes the evolution of the research related to diaspora networks in IB. The purpose of this review is multifaceted. First  it introduces the concepts diaspora and diaspora networks and links them to economy and IB. Second  it identifies the key aspects of diaspora-related research that are significant for IB and/or require additional attention in the IB domain. Furthermore  it provides a state-of-the-art review of the diaspora networks in IB. The review comprises multiple viewpoints on diaspora networks: organization and structure  resources  diaspora entrepreneurship  socio-cultural dimensions and knowledge transfer as well as underlying emotional and behavioral frameworks. The chapter contributes by synthesizing and modifying the extant knowledge base and evaluating it critically. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for theory modification  IB management  and policy making  and it proposes future research directions.
4,  Typology of diaspora entrepreneurship: Case studies in Uzbekistan   The characteristics and importance of transnational diasporans as entrepreneurs for the economy and international business of emerging countries have remained underexplored. This paper addresses types of diaspora entrepreneurship (DE) theoretically and empirically in the context of Uzbekistan. Diaspora entrepreneurship is often seen as necessity-driven and less opportunity-driven. So far  emerging Central-Asian countries are considered countries of origin (COOs) of diasporans  but not yet as countries wherein diasporans want to invest and work  that is  countries of residence (CORs). Uzbekistan is also a post-Soviet economy with limited tradition on private entrepreneurship. Thus  the paper asks what makes people become entrepreneurs in emerging countries such as Uzbekistan when they have alternative opportunities in developed countries. It explores key drivers and socio-cultural reasons for the entry and establishment decision and introduces a typology of DE. This multiple case study presents implications and findings on culturally different entrepreneurs who have decided to enter Uzbek business elucidating their motivations and role in transition economies.
5,  Diaspora networks in international business and transnational entrepreneurship-A literature review   Many underlying developments of globalization should be investigated. Diaspora networks represent an invisible actor in international business (IB)  and embody a channel and arena for transnational entrepreneurship (TE). Thus  understanding the development of contemporary diaspora networks and exploring their business potential is important. These networks impact multiple aspects of economic activity  such as investment  entrepreneurship  innovation  expansion  internationalization and creation of international businesses. Despite the multifaceted influence of diaspora networks  little empirical research on their effects has been conducted. This gap may originate in the lack of theoretical and conceptual rigor. In short  the term “diaspora network” remains to be fully discovered in international business. This paper contributes to the literature by increasing the understanding of diaspora networks by reviewing the current literature. The purpose is to enrich the conceptual and theoretical development of IB and TE by connecting them to the emerging field of diaspora entrepreneurship. The paper discusses diaspora networks  illustrates extant theories and research findings  and suggests issues for further research.
6,  Migration 'against the tide': location and Jewish diaspora entrepreneurs   Diaspora entrepreneurs contribute to regional development through business  ideas and resources. Most diasporas originate from migration from developing and emerging economies and are captured in dyadic patterns between the country of origin and their residence. Understudied are diaspora entrepreneurs migrating ‘against the tide’ by selecting atypical destination region(s). This qualitative study examines the migratory paths of Jewish diaspora entrepreneurs departing from their communities and planting seeds at new locations for their communities to follow – in other words  leaving their communities behind physically  not mentally. Findings advance a theoretical understanding of diasporic entrepreneurial types  contexts and the dynamic interplay between pioneering entrepreneur(s)  their community and their location.
7,  Human stickiness as a counterforce to brain drain: Purpose driven behavior among Tanzanian medical doctors and implications for policy   We explain why a group of Tanzanian medical doctors decided to stay in their home country despite a massive brain drain and pressure to migrate. We argue that purpose-driven behaviour among medical doctors serves as a counterforce to brain drain  fostering human stickiness in a developing country context. A sense of purpose provides a novel lens to understand voluntary non-migration of highly-skilled professionals under extreme conditions. Furthermore  incoming expatriate doctors build local capacity by sharing skills and expertise with Tanzanian doctors. This affects the medical doctors’ motives to migrate  further reducing brain drain. These individual-level decisions not to migrate find their application in policy. We advocate policies that support purpose-driven behaviour and generate long-term commitment to a location  while advancing short-term mobility for knowledge sharing. The policy initiatives are targeted at actors in the sending and receiving countries as well as in international organisations  covering concerted multi-layered policies to support family and community embeddedness  to facilitate the incoming of expatriate doctors and foreign exchange  and to cultivate benefits of circular migration. We argue that migration behaviour is more individually grounded and socio-emotionally constructed than what dominant economic-based explanations suggest.
8,  Is this transnational entrepreneurship? Five cases in which it is hard to say yes or no   Scholars have lately started using the notion of ‘transnational entrepreneurship’. However  transnational entrepreneurship has not achieved the status of an independent research field in literature yet. Scholars and policymakers do not seem to have managed to address the clear-cut  distinctive nature of transnational entrepreneurship due to its conceptual ambiguity. This challenge calls for thoughtful consideration of the scope and range of the transnational entrepreneurship concept. Consequently  this study aims at critically reviewing the recent literature on transnational entrepreneurship in contrast to migrants’ entrepreneurial activities and international entrepreneurship to identify the current scholars’ underlying assumptions about this phenomenon and challenges them by demonstrating its heterogeneity with the presentation of five empirical cases. In these five cases  entrepreneurs conduct business in which transnationalism plays a certain role  yet differently. We contrast the presented cases with the four assumptions about transnational entrepreneurs identified from literature: (a) frequent travels between home and host countries  (b) simultaneous entrepreneurial engagement in two countries  (c) deep dual embeddedness in home and host institutional environments and (d) highly educated migrants. Based on the discussion  we develop a set of research propositions regarding the characteristics of transnational entrepreneurs  which are not fully considered in literature. By demonstrating the heterogeneity of transnational entrepreneurship and by showing future research orientations  we contribute to the literature on transnational entrepreneurship.
9,  Transnational entrepreneurship: opportunity identifcation and venture creation   The present case study focuses on entrepreneurs who have migrated from one developed economy (Sweden or Finland) to another developed economy (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)). In contrast to the dominating understanding  we find that the transnational entrepreneurial incentives were opportunity driven rather than necessity based. The opportunity types identified varied  but indicate the importance of service opportunities  a type often left out of studies and classifications. A prevalent characteristic of transnational entrepreneurship is opportunity recognition based on introducing processes or products to the country of residence  familiar from the country of origin or based on use of the entrepreneurs’ contacts in the home country. This study showed  however  that although this was the case for two entrepreneurs  some identified opportunities for acting in the opposite direction  or did both import and export. Notably  there was also a fourth category  offering business-facilitating services  bridging differing cultural contexts in relationship-middlemen positions. For these entrepreneurs  there was thus no obvious “domestic market” from the start as assumed in traditional internationalization theories. Furthermore  although their businesses started on a limited scale between two countries  they quickly grew and entered other country markets. These transnational businesses thus represent forms of born globals not included in the high-tech business models often associated with such firms. Our findings finally lend support to arguments that a business-favorable institutional environment facilitates and encourages entrepreneurship.
10,  Network benefits for Ghaninan diaspora and returnee entrpreneurs    Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate how diaspora and returnee entrepreneurs use networks in the country of origin (COO) and country of residence (COR) and which benefits they gain from such networks. Research Design & Methods: In the face of the early state of research and the complexity of the subject  exploratory case study research was chosen. One case was conducted with a Ghanaian diaspora entrepreneur in Germany and the other with a Ghanaian returnee entrepreneur back from Germany. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews with both of the entrepreneurs were conducted to identify their network dynamics. Findings: Ghanaian diaspora entrepreneurs benefit mainly from networks in the COR and Ghanaian returnee entrepreneurs from networks in the COO. These findings are not fully consistent with the assumption of previous scholars that diaspora and returnee entrepreneurs intensively use both COO and COR networks. Implications & Recommendations: The network usage of diaspora and returnee entrepreneurs varies to a large extent depending on industry  personal background and human capital. It is necessary to research more intensively the heterogeneity within diaspora entrepreneurship. Contribution & Value Added: This paper contributes to the development of understanding of heterogeneity in diaspora and returnee entrepreneurship. The cases present that the degree and balance of mixed embeddedness of returnee and diaspora entrepreneurs in COO and COR may differ to a large extent and they influence how they benefit from different type of networks in both countries. This difference may arise from the physical absence/presence of entrepreneurs in the country or the structure of their business. We identified several dimensions to be considered in future research.
11,  Engaging diasporas as international entrepreneurs in developing countries: In search of determinants   Diaspora has been increasingly recognized by practitioners and scholars as an important factor of development in developing economies. Through their remittances and expertise  diaspora members have become an important source of foreign direct investment and managerial capabilities. Although the literature is glutted with examples of the impact of diaspora in fostering international entrepreneurship and reducing poverty  a theoretical foundation and framework is needed to explain this impact. This study explores a theoretical foundation of the diaspora entrepreneurship. A framework identifying the determinants of the diaspora’s international new venture creation in the country of origin is developed. The study suggests that diaspora international entrepreneurship depends on the level of altruistic motivation  need of social recognition  entrepreneurial opportunities  friendliness and receptivity of the home country  as well as integration of and support to immigrants in the host countries. Propositions for diaspora entrepreneurship are developed.
12,  Ethnic ties  motivations  and home country entry strategy of transnational entrepreneurs   Based on 30 in-depth interviews with Indian transnational entrepreneurs (TEs) in the USA and their corresponding India heads of operations  we explore the influence of TEs’ ethnic ties on their motivations and entry strategy in the formation of transnational ventures in their home country. Our findings show the heterogeneity of TEs’ motivations (economic and emotional) and home country entry strategy (proactive and reactive). Further  we find that TEs’ entry strategy is contingent on their (a) use of professional and personal ethnic ties and (b) prior experience of doing business with the home country. These findings contribute to the transnational and immigrant entrepreneurship literatures. 
13, Transnational diasporan entrepreneurs are migrants and their descendants who establish entrepreneurial activities that span the national business environments of their countries of origin and countries of residence. We explore how business incubators contribute to the economic development of emerging markets by organizing their programs to bridge the institutional divides that transnational diaspora entrepreneurs face when establishing their multi-territorial ventures in these markets. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in the Netherlands during 2007  we present the case study of IntEnt  an incubator providing services exclusively to transnational diasporan entrepreneurs. We apply Bergek and Norrman's (2008) assessment framework to this case  examining IntEnt's goals  model (selection  business support  and mediation activities)  and outcomes. Employing Eisenhardt's case-based theory development approach (1989)  we then leverage case findings to generate theory about the institutional challenges faced by transnational diaspora entrepreneurs and the role that incubators can play in helping these entrepreneurs overcome these challenges.
14, Diasporans are migrants and their descendants who maintain a relationship to their country of origin (Safran  1991). Diasporans who establish new ventures in their countries of origin comprise a special case of international ethnic entrepreneurship.In countries of settlement  diasporans confront institutional environments that often are quite different than those that exist in their countries of origin. We refer to the exposure to and adoption of institutional roles and relationships associated with a new cultural setting as “institutional acculturation.” Most extant work in management and marketing focuses on how a migrant's acculturation affects his/her behavior in the new country of residence. We shift the analytical lens to the country of origin. Utilizing a case study from Nepal  we demonstrate how institutional acculturation can inspire a diaspora entrepreneur to transform institutional arrangements in his/her country of origin and generate dramatic change in society's role expectations of the government  suppliers  and buyers.
15, The spatialities of migrant entrepreneurship have changed dynamically in recent decades. Movements and exchanges transcend national borders more than ever  and transnational migrant entrepreneurship has become a burgeoning field of research. Yet  knowledge is dispersed across disciplines  and an understanding of contemporary spatialities is limited. We review 155 articles published in English  French  German  and Spanish since 2009  thereby providing an overview of existing knowledge on transnational migrant entrepreneurship and suggesting avenues for future research. We identify five current topical areas of research: (1) the business advantages of transnational migrant entrepreneurship  (2) the determinants of becoming a transnational migrant entrepreneur  (3) the transnational networks of migrants  (4) the economic impacts of transnational migrant entrepreneurship on home and host countries  and (5) whether local environments enable or deter entrepreneurial success. Building on our synthesis of the most recent literature  we propose three crucial dimensions which have been under-researched in past and current work  and which address the diversity of geographical locations  spatial connections  and spatial mobilities involved in transnational migrant entrepreneurship. Moreover  we put forward a set of questions for future research which will advance a comprehension of unequal opportunities among transnational migrant entrepreneurs.
16, Transnational entrepreneurship studies highlight the importance of personal profiles  institutions  and networks in creating and succeeding in this type of entrepreneurship. Even so  less is known about migrants whose networks are fragmented and closed  facing challenging environments at home and abroad. This paper aims to study the attributes of transnational entrepreneurs with small and fragmented networks  from post-conflict environments  who can perform an important role in the socioeconomic development and internationalization level of their countries of origin due to the cross border mobilization of resources they encourage. For that reason  the specific case of Colombian transnational entrepreneurs who have been able to overcome those obstacles with their transnational business is analyzed with the intention of understanding how they manage those shortcomings when engaging in transnational entrepreneurship. In aiming to obtain a deeper understanding of their characteristics  similitudes  differences  and motivations  the research uses multiple case studies. The main findings suggest that transnational entrepreneurs form purposeful–strategic networks to compensate their lack of amalgamated social systems  and that they have special qualities that distinguish them from other Colombian migrants and transnational entrepreneurs. Moreover  Colombian transnational entrepreneurs focus their business in the international market  using strategically their knowledge of both the local and foreign environment  while their main interest to do so is not altruistic but business oriented. Governments from post-conflict countries should promote transnational entrepreneurship while facilitating network formation and institutional trust through diverse strategies. Finally  implications for further research are drawn.
17, The objective of this study is to inform and invigorate international business (IB) research on migrant entrepreneurship. Migrant entrepreneurship is an important global phenomenon that is relevant to diverse scholarly conversations. Yet  to date  it has received scant attention in IB compared with research in other disciplines. Our study aims to take stock of existing research on migrant entrepreneurship across eight disciplinary areas. We conducted a thematic analysis of 373 articles. The resulting thematic inventory was organized by the antecedents  success factors and moderators of migrant entrepreneurship. We highlight the implications of this analysis for future research in IB.
18, Despite increased academic attention paid to migration flows in Europe  the gendered nature of transnational migrant entrepreneurial journeys within the context of a family business remains under-researched. We address this gap by investigating how transnational spaces allow women to challenge dominant ideas about their roles  and to claim legitimacy by opening branches of their family business abroad. With extensive longitudinal evidence collected over a seven-year period  we showcase four biographical narratives of women operating transnational family businesses in the UK that had originated in Eastern Europe. Adopting this novel longitudinal approach  we provide insights into how these transnational migrant women entrepreneurs exercise individual agency to overcome structural constraints by developing strategies that prioritize their own business aspirations without fully sacrificing their family ties.
19, Literature on immigrant and ethnic minority entrepreneurship almost exclusively focusses on the west  while neglecting other world regions. This neglect is problematic not only because international migration is on the rise outside the west  but also because it reveals an implicit ethnocentrism and creates particular presumptions about the nature of ethnic minority entrepreneurship that may not be as universally valid as is often presumed. The purpose of this paper is to examine ethnic minority entrepreneurship in non-western contexts to critically assess two of these presumptions  namely that it occurs in the economic margins and within clear ethnic community boundaries. Design/methodology/approach
20, The authors draw on academic literature (including the authors’ own) to develop two case descriptions of ethnic minority entrepreneurship outside the west: the Mennonites in Belize and the Chinese in Cambodia. For each case  the authors describe the historic entrepreneurial trajectory  i.e. the historical emergence of entrepreneurship in light of relevant community and society contexts. Findings The two cases reveal that  in contrast to characterisations of ethnic minority entrepreneurship in the west  the Mennonites in Belize and the Chinese in Cambodia have come to comprise the economic upper class  and their business activities are not confined to ethnic community boundaries. Originality/value The paper is the first to elaborate the importance of studying ethnic minority entrepreneurship outside the west  both as an aim in itself and as a catalyst to work towards a more neutral framework.
